# Custom-Alpaca-Style-Dataset-Generation
This project aimed to address the requirements of the company's Language Model (LLM) training by leveraging Stanford's Dataset System and OpenAI's powerful language model. The objective was to create a more suitable and domain-specific dataset to enhance the LLM's capabilities for the company's intern-assigned tasks.
